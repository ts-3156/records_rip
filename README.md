# Records, R.I.P.

This gem is a place to let deleted records rest in peace. :coffin:

Soft deletes are evil. _Blest be y man y spares thes stones. And curst be he y moves my bones._

## Getting Started

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'records_rip'
```

Add `rest_in_peace` to the models you want to visit the tomb.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  rest_in_place
end
```

#### Scopes

You can perform WHERE queries for `tombs#epitaph` based on attributes:

```ruby
User.tomb(name: 'Smith')
```
